                <h2>Quotes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I might not be over-enthusiastic about socializing and making friends, but I am not a loner. I
                        love hanging out with my friends, and I do it often when I am not working. Maybe, since I am not
                        often invited to the 'happening' parties of our industry, where the media is around, I have
                        earned the reputation of being a loner.</li>
                    <li>[on nepotism] Over a period of time, if we keep giving chances to people who don't have any
                        talent or skills, then eventually, we will create an unbalanced equation. The whole industry
                        will collapse because the target audience is being exposed to wonderful international cinema and
                        talent. We are yet to reach that tipping point, but we must never take the audience's
                        understanding and our relevance for granted.</li>
                    <li>Individuals can benefit from Nepotism and can thrive. But in the long run the practice could be
                        fatal to an unstructured industry.</li>
                    <li>You look in one direction, and you find mediocrity and nepotism thriving, and you can't come up
                        with a logical reason to explain it. In the other direction, you see immense respect for
                        passion, talent and professionalism, irrespective of being an insider or an outsider.</li>
                    <li>[on maintaining distance from media] I have my reasons. Everybody is in a hurry to decode you in
                        a certain way, and then they expect you to adhere to their definition. How can they possibly do
                        that when you yourself are finding it hard to discover yourself? How many interviews and
                        questions does it take to tell everyone what you think? There are many things you can say once
                        you cultivate your opinion, and that comes with experience, which - at this point - I don't have
                        much of.</li>
                    <li>I really wanted to buy a Range Rover. It was a big dream, and the day I bought it, I was very
                        happy, but by evening, I was immune to it. That's when I realized that excitement if it's
                        happiness, is not in reaching the goal but in the process. Thus process trumps over realization.
                    </li>
                    <li>I'm a trained engineer, so I'm conditioned to come up with a right answer to a difficult
                        situation, but when it comes to art, there is no definite answer because it's so subjective.
